#Needs to be added

- Drop down menus on hover need to be added to textbook area
- Calendar API needs to be finalized and actually working. Ideally hosted locally rather than pulling from api to decrease latency
- Help button needs to be aligned to bottom corner and turned into an actual button
- The problem with the google extension security needs to be fixed
- Customization could be added
