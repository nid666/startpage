# Ideas
- Prep sports schedule?
        - Would be possible but we would need to make sure every sport has a google calendar and keeps it updated. It would cause problems if people didn't show up to practice because the start page didn't show anything
- Possibly social media, probably not needed
        - school wouldn't like people going on social media
- Map that shows places where people can go to eat by class year
        - Is this really needed? If we add a lot of stuff, especially complicated maps api things or images, it would slow down the initial load time of the start page, along with the fact that most class years know this already
- Custom snow day calculator
        - The school would not like this, it would cause problems with the snow day thing because it would make it look like the school is supporting the percent value shown by the calculator
- Possibly pull stuff from announcements emails to show upcoming clubs/activities or show an alert if there is any change in usual schedule.
